# **Summary**
### We analyzed campaign marketing data in which new financial services were offered to customers. We paid particular attention to linear models and investigated how the probability of a successful outcome can be modeled as a function of different macroeconomics factors. From a technical perspective, we introduced linear models (such as linear and logistic regression).
